# Metasheller

Metasheller is a pip installable package to create metacells using SEACells quickly (and in parallel). 

I've applied it to noisy scRNA data from many samples prior to running SLIDE, and to reduce the number of representative cells of a certain clonotype.

```bash
conda create -n metasheller-env python=3.8

```
